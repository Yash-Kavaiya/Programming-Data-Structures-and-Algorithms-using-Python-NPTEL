I'll explain each question in detail, covering the Python concepts involved.

## Question 1: Finding the Error Statement

Let's trace through each statement carefully:

```python
x = ["slithy",[7,10,12],2,"tove",1]  # Statement 1
```
- Creates a list with mixed types (strings, list, integers)
- No error here

```python
y = x[0:50]                          # Statement 2
```
- Slicing with an end index beyond the list length is valid in Python
- Returns a copy of the entire list: `["slithy",[7,10,12],2,"tove",1]`
- No error

```python
z = y                                # Statement 3
```
- Simple assignment, z now references the same list as y
- No error

```python
w = x                                # Statement 4
```
- w now references the same list as x
- No error

```python
x[0] = x[0][:5] + 'ery'              # Statement 5
```
- `x[0]` is "slithy" (6 characters)
- `x[0][:5]` gives "slith"
- `"slith" + "ery"` = "slithery"
- Assigns "slithery" to x[0]
- No error (we're replacing the entire element, not modifying the string in-place)

```python
y[2] = 4                             # Statement 6
```
- y[2] was 2, now becomes 4
- No error

```python
z[4] = 42                            # Statement 7
```
- Since z references the same list as y, this modifies y[4] (which was 1) to 42
- No error

```python
w[0][:3] = 'fea'                     # Statement 8
```
- `w[0]` is now "slithery" (since w references x)
- `w[0][:3]` attempts to assign to a slice of a string
- **This causes a TypeError!** Strings are immutable in Python
- You cannot do `string[:3] = something`

```python
x[1][0] = 5555                       # Statement 9
```
- `x[1]` is the list `[7,10,12]`
- `x[1][0] = 5555` modifies the first element of that list
- Would work if we reached it

```python
a = (x[4][1] == 1)                   # Statement 10
```
- This would cause an error because x[4] is now 42 (an integer)
- Can't index an integer with [1]
- But we never reach this due to error in Statement 8

**Answer: 8**

## Question 2: List References and Mutations

Let's trace through step by step:

```python
b = [23,44,87,100]
```
Initial state: `b = [23,44,87,100]`

```python
a = b[1:]
```
- Creates a **new list** containing elements from index 1 onward
- `a = [44,87,100]` (independent copy)

```python
d = b[2:]
```
- Creates another **new list** from index 2 onward
- `d = [87,100]` (independent copy)

```python
c = b
```
- **Important**: This doesn't create a copy!
- c now references the **same list object** as b
- Any changes to c affect b and vice versa

```python
d[0] = 97
```
- Modifies d's first element
- `d = [97,100]`
- This doesn't affect b, a, or c because d is a separate list

```python
c[2] = 77
```
- Since c and b reference the same list, this modifies b[2] as well
- `b = [23,44,77,100]` and `c = [23,44,77,100]`
- Note: a is unaffected because it's a separate list

Final values:
- `a = [44,87,100]` → a[1] = 87
- `b = [23,44,77,100]` → b[2] = 77
- `c = [23,44,77,100]` → c[2] = 77
- `d = [97,100]` → d[0] = 97

**Answer: a[1] == 87, b[2] == 77, c[2] == 77, d[0] == 97**

## Question 3: String Reversal Logic

```python
startmsg = "python"
endmsg = ""
for i in range(1,1+len(startmsg)):
  endmsg = startmsg[-i] + endmsg
```

Let's trace through the loop:
- `len(startmsg)` = 6
- `range(1,7)` produces: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Iteration by iteration:
1. i=1: `startmsg[-1]` = 'n', `endmsg = 'n' + '' = 'n'`
2. i=2: `startmsg[-2]` = 'o', `endmsg = 'o' + 'n' = 'on'`
3. i=3: `startmsg[-3]` = 'h', `endmsg = 'h' + 'on' = 'hon'`
4. i=4: `startmsg[-4]` = 't', `endmsg = 't' + 'hon' = 'thon'`
5. i=5: `startmsg[-5]` = 'y', `endmsg = 'y' + 'thon' = 'ython'`
6. i=6: `startmsg[-6]` = 'p', `endmsg = 'p' + 'ython' = 'python'`

The algorithm builds the string from right to left, effectively reversing it. Since "python" is a palindrome when reversed, we get "python" again.

**Answer: 'python'**

## Question 4: Function Parameter Behavior

```python
def mystery(l):
  l = l[1:]
  return()

mylist = [7,11,13]
mystery(mylist)
```

Key concept: **Parameter passing and local assignment**

When `mystery(mylist)` is called:
1. The parameter `l` initially references the same list as `mylist`
2. However, `l = l[1:]` creates a **new list** `[11,13]` and assigns it to the local variable `l`
3. This reassignment makes `l` point to a new object
4. The original `mylist` remains unchanged
5. The function returns None (empty return)

Common misconception: If the function had done `l[0] = 99` instead, it WOULD modify mylist, because that modifies the list in-place rather than creating a new one.

**Answer: [7,11,13]**

## Key Python Concepts Covered:

1. **String immutability**: Cannot modify strings in-place
2. **List slicing**: Creates new lists (copies)
3. **Reference vs. copy**: `a = b` creates a reference, `a = b[:]` creates a copy
4. **Negative indexing**: `-1` is last element, `-2` is second-to-last, etc.
5. **Function parameters**: Reassigning a parameter doesn't affect the original variable
6. **Mutable vs. immutable**: Lists can be modified, strings cannot
